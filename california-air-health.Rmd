## Motivation and Overview

Nearly [90 million Americans](https://i.redd.it/bbnxf9b8rm321.jpg) are breathing air that doesn't meet the World Health Oranizations safe PM2.5 limit. The [UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs](https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/public-health/pm25.html) states that long-term PM2.5 exposure poses a variety of health risks; most commonly, health consequences due to long-term PM2.5 exposure take the form of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. This poses a serious public health problem because such diseases reduce both quality and length of life. 

There are many sources of PM2.5, including vehicular emissions and ash. California's large traffic volume and increasingly frequent wildfires both contribute to the state's PM2.5 levels. While wildfires are natural, climate change is making them more common and more severe. According to the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ca.pdf), the state of California is becoming warmer as a whole and southern California, in particular, is becoming drier. California's average annual precipitation and temperature from 1895-2017 are shown below. These unnaturally warm and dry conditions promote frequent and devastating wildfires. 

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/science-fires-2.png?w=1150)

California's burgeoning population has expanded into many high-risk fire zones. [TIME](http://time.com/4985252/california-wildfires-fires-climate-change/) reports on a 2017 Verisk risk analysis which found that "15% -- or over 2 million -- of California's homes [are] in high or extremely high wildfire risk zones and another 12% in moderate risk areas." Concurrently, large fires have become more common in California, as seen in the chart below. Each bar represents a single fire, and the bar height represents the size of areas burned in acres. The proximity of these populations to PM2.5 sources such as wildfires puts them at increased risk of unhealthy exposure levels (not to mention the risks of the wildfire itself). 

![](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/responsive/2018/ca-wildfires/img/cal-fires-1970-2017.svg)

We are interested in investigating California county-level hospitalization rates as a function of the annual number of days each county had PM2.5 levels over the national standard.

## Related Work

A 2006 study by Dominici, Peng, and Bell showed that short-term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Specifically, there was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with PM2.5 for heart disease, heart rhythm, heart failure, COPD, and respiratory infection; the largest association was for heart failure. In a 2009 paper, Neupane et al. found that long-term exposure to higher levels of nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 is significantly associated with hospitalization for community-aquired pneumonia among elderly patients in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Similarly, Ostro et al. found in 2008 that components of PM2.5 were associated with several childhood respiratory diseases including pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma among children in six California counties. Much work on the association of PM2.5 with health outcomes focuses on birth outcomes or respiratory issues; we expand this exploration to all classifications of preventable hospitalization.

Bell et al. examine how air pollution control could not only prevent adverse health outcomes but also make a monumental economic impact. Air pollution control policy could help prevent over 156,000 deaths, 4 million asthma attacks, 300,000 children's medical visits, and almost 48,000 cases of chronic bronchitis over a twenty-year period in Santiago, Sao Paulo, and Mexico City; the economic value of these avoided health outcomes is about 21-165 billion USD. Fisk and Chan found in 2016 that using portable air cleaners led to economic benefits exceeding or far exceeding intervention costs. Thus, understanding how PM2.5 is related to preventable hospitalizations can help California counties plan for intervention or even prevention efforts as well as budget for the impact of adverse health outcomes from wildfires.

## Initial Questions

Our primary research question is what, if any, is the effect of PM2.5 on hospitalization rates in California? We further want to investigate how this effect differs by medical condition. Additional questions relevant to the analysis are (1) to what extent is hospitalization rate spatially or temporally correlated, and (2) to what extent is the predictor PM2.5 spatially or temporally correlated?

## Data

We obtained our health-related data from the [California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/rates-of-preventable-hospitalizations-for-selected-medical-conditions-by-county). The data contain annual hospitalization rates by county for a selection of preventable medical conditions. The rates are calculated using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and then standardized to the number of hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals.

```{r Read in data 1 (Ruthe)}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate); library(stringr); library(stringr); library(rgdal); library("SpatioTemporal"); library("sp"); library("mgcv"); library("spdep"); library("CARBayesST"); library("ape"); library(kableExtra)

ph_late <- phosp %>% filter(Year >= 2016) %>% group_by(County, Year) %>% dplyr::select(Year, County, PQIDescription, ObsRate_ICD10) %>% spread(PQIDescription, value = ObsRate_ICD10) %>% rename(asthma_older = "COPD or Asthma in Older Adults (Age 40+)", diabetes_st = "Diabetes Short-term Complications", perf_appendix = "Perforated Appendix", diabetes_lt = "Diabetes Long-term Complications", hypertension = "Hypertension", heart_fail = "Heart Failure", dehydration = "Dehydration", pneumonia = "Community-Acquired Pneumonia", uti = "Urinary Tract Infection", diabetes_uc = "Uncontrolled Diabetes", asthma_young = "Asthma in Younger Adults (Age 18-39)", amputation_diab = "Lower-Extremity Amputation (Diabetes)", pq_overall = "Prevention Quality Overall Composite", pq_acute = "Prevention Quality Acute Composite", pq_chronic = "Prevention Quality Chronic Composite", pq_diabetes = "Prevention Quality Diabetes Composite") %>% mutate(angina = NA)

phosp <- rbind(ph_early, ph_late) %>% arrange(County) %>% rename(county = County, year = Year)
head(phosp)
```

We obtained our air quality-related data from the [California Air Resources Board](https://www.arb.ca.gov/adam/index.html). The data include PM2.5 levels by county. To match the granularity of our health data, we chose to use the annual days above the national 24-hour standard as our air quality metric.

```{r Read in data 2 (Ruthe)}
pm25 <- read_csv("data/pm25_annual-days-above-nat-24-hr-stnd.csv", na = "*") %>% group_by(county) %>% summarize(pm2010 = mean(pm2010, na.rm = T), pm2011 = mean(pm2011, na.rm = T), pm2012 = mean(pm2012, na.rm = T), pm2013 = mean(pm2013, na.rm = T), pm2014 = mean(pm2014, na.rm = T), pm2015 = mean(pm2015, na.rm = T), pm2016 = mean(pm2016, na.rm = T), pm2017 = mean(pm2017, na.rm = T)) %>% gather(year, pm25, pm2010:pm2017) %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(str_sub(year, 3, 6))) %>% arrange(county)
head(pm25)
```

We also obtained county-level demographic data to control for any potential effect of demographic features on hospitalization rates; these data were obtained from the [US Census Bureau](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t&keepList=f).

```{r Read in data 3 (Ruthe)}
demo <- read_csv("data/age_edu_race.csv")[ , -1] %>% group_by(Geography, Year) %>% filter(bachelor_perc <= 100) %>% summarize(age60_perc = mean(age60_perc, na.rm = T), bachelor_perc = mean(bachelor_perc, na.rm = T), est.white.percent = mean(est.white.percent, na.rm = T), est.black.percent = mean(est.black.percent, na.rm = T)) %>% ungroup() %>% mutate(Geography = str_sub(Geography, 1, -20)) %>% rename(county = Geography, year = Year)
head(demo)
```

We merged the above datasets by county and year. The air quality data were only from the years 2010-2017, so we excluded any additional years from the other two datasets. Next, we checked each variable for unreasonable values. There were some values in the demographic data variables that were unreasonable (e.g. percentiles above 100\% describing a county's estimated percent of black residents); we excluded these rows.

```{r Read in data 4 (Ruthe)}
dat <- demo %>% left_join(pm25, by = c("county", "year")) %>% left_join(phosp, by = c("county", "year")) %>% mutate(region = NA, region = replace(region, county %in% c("Del Norte", "Humboldt", "Mendocino", "Lake", "Siskiyou", "Trinity", "Shasta", "Tehema", "Butte", "Yuba",
"Sacramento", "Modoc", "Lassen"), "northern"), region = replace(region, county %in% c("Sonoma", "Marin", "Solano", "Napa", "Yolo", "Contra Costa", "Alameda", "San Mateo", "Santa Clara", "Santa Cruz", "San Benito", "Monterey", "San Luis Obispo", "Santa Barbara", "Ventura", "Orange", "San Diego", "Riverside", "Sierra", "Nevada", "Placer", "El Dorado", "Amador", "Mono"), "coastal"), region = replace(region, county %in% c("Alpine", "Calaveras", "Tuolumne", "Mariposa", "Inyo"), "motherlode"), region = replace(region, county %in% c("Glenn", "Colusa", "Sutter", "San Joaquin", "Stanislaus", "Merced", "Madera", "Fresno", "Kings", "Tulare", "Kern", "Los Angeles", "San Bernardino"), "farm"), region = replace(region, county == "San Francisco", "sanfrancisco"), region = replace(region, county == "Imperial", "imperial"))

# save(dat, file = "data/dat.R")
rm(list = setdiff(ls(), "dat"))
head(dat)
```

The data were originally in long format; each row represented a county, year, and medical condition combination. We spread the data to wide format so that each medical condition had its own column containing its associated annual hospitalization rates. The new dataframe had a row for each county and year combination. This dataframe was used for all subsequent analyses. 

We also use a California counties shapefile in order to visualize geographical trends.

```{r maps (Ruthe)}
cali <- readOGR(dsn = "data/CA_Counties", layer = "CA_Counties_TIGER2016")
cali$NAME <- as.character(cali$NAME)
```

```{r (Xinye) data for EDA and GAM, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Prepare data

# 1. latitude and longitude
loc = cali@data[,c(5,6,ncol(cali@data)-1,ncol(cali@data))]
loc$NAME = as.character(loc$NAME)
names(loc)[1] = "county"
loc$NAMELSAD = as.character(loc$NAMELSAD)

# 2. xy coordinates using WGS84, just in case
# source: https://rpubs.com/dasaptaerwin/19879
xy <- as.data.frame(loc[,c(3,4)])
xy <- as.data.frame(apply(xy,2,function(x){as.numeric(as.character(x))}))
cord.dec = SpatialPoints(cbind(xy$INTPTLON,-xy$INTPTLAT), 
                         proj4string=CRS("+proj=longlat"))
coord <- as.data.frame(spTransform(cord.dec, CRS("+init=epsg:32748")))

#3. combine latlong and coordinates
loc.all <- data.frame(loc,x = coord$coords.x1, y = coord$coords.x2)


#4. merge; convert lat and long to numeric 
# this is the data used for GAM, but not for CAR model

datnew <- left_join(dat,loc.all,by = "county") %>% 
  mutate(lat = as.numeric(as.character(INTPTLAT)),
         long = as.numeric(as.character(INTPTLON))) 

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We first explore general trends across all California counties for PM2.5 and our outcomes of interest -- specifically, asthma in younger adults (18-39 years of age), asthma/COPD in older adults (40+ years of age), pneumonia, heart failure, diabetes with short-term complications. We create functions for creating choropleth maps:

```{r CA visualizations (Ruthe)}

    0), bty = "n", cex = 2)
```

### Health Outcomes Over Time

#### 1. Asthma (in Younger Adults)
```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 14, echo = F}
bigplot("asthma_young", cut = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 125))
bigplot("asthma_young")
```

#### 2. Asthma/COPD (in Older Adults)
```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 14, echo = F}
bigplot("asthma_older", cut = c(100, 250, 400, 600, 800, 1000))
bigplot("asthma_older")
```

#### 3. Pneumonia
```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 14, echo = F}
bigplot("pneumonia", cut = c(50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 550))
bigplot("pneumonia")
```

#### 4. Heart Failure
```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 14, echo = F}
bigplot("heart_fail", cut = c(120, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600))
bigplot("heart_fail")
```

#### 5. Diabetes (Short-Term Complications)
```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 14, echo = F}
bigplot("diabetes_st", cut = c(15, 45, 75, 100, 120, 150))
bigplot("diabetes_st")
```

We also examine trends by regions. In 2002, the California Department of Social Services performed a cluster analysis of counties on six key characteristics: (1) welfare dependency rate, (2) annual unemployment rate, (3) percent of population in poverty, (4) percent of children reported to child welfare services, (5) percent of the population identified as Hispanic, and (6) percent of the population participating in an SSI/SSP program. All characteristics were taken from 2000 metrics. The regions are defined as follows:

  - **Northern Region:** Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Siskiyou, Trinity, Shasta, Tehama, Butte, Yuba, Sacramento, Modoc, Lassen
  - **Coastal Region plus Tahoe Area:** Sonoma, Marin, Solano, Napa, Yolo, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Mono
  - **Mother Lode Mountain Region:** Alpine, Calaveras, Tuolumne, Mariposa, Inyo
  - **Farm Region:** Glenn, Colusa, Sutter, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare, Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino
  - **San Francisco:** San Francisco
  - **Imperial:** Imperial

#### 1. Spatial and temporal pattern for PM2.5
PM2.5 levels vary across different regions with high variability in the farm region and lower variability across counties in other regions. The temporal patterns for PM2.5 are also heterogeneous across regions and counties.

```{r (Xinye) EDA, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# EDA: temporal trend in each region
plot_pm25_time <- datnew %>% group_by(year, county) %>% filter(!is.na(pm25)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pm25,color = county)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam",formula = y~s(x,k= 5),se = FALSE,size = .5) +
  facet_wrap(.~region,ncol = 5) + 
  labs(title = "Temporal trends of PM2.5 across regions") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,size = 10),
        legend.position = "bottom")

plot_pm25_time
```

#### 2. Spatial autocorrelation 

Our data are correlated because of their intrinsic geographical clustering. We start with a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) which assumes independence of data and we test the existence of spatial autocorrelations among residuals via Moran's I Index. 9 out of 17 causes of the preventable hospitalization rate are spatially autocorrelated. Hospitalization causes for which we fail to detect spatial autocorrelation after accounting PM2.5 and other covariates include angina, dehydration, diabetes short-term complications, hypertension, lower-extremity amputation, perforated appendix, uncontrolled diabetes, and prevention quality diabetes composite.

```{r (Xinye) Morans I-testing spatial autocorrelation, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ca.dists <- as.matrix(dist(cbind(datnew$long, datnew$lat)))
ca.dists.inv <- 1/ca.dists
diag(ca.dists.inv) <- 0
ca.dists.inv[is.infinite(ca.dists.inv)] <- 0

# a function that returns pvalue from Moran's I index testing
moransI.pval <- function(y){
  res = rep(NA,320)
  if (! y %in% names(datnew)[8:24]) 
  {print("Outcome does not exist")}
  
  else{
    y2 = as.vector(pull(datnew[,y]))
    
    datnew_copy <- data.frame(datnew) %>% 
      dplyr::mutate(outcome_interest = y2) %>%
      dplyr::select(outcome_interest,year,age60_perc,est.black.percent,
                    bachelor_perc,pm25)
    
    fit_glm = glm(outcome_interest ~ pm25 + age60_perc + est.black.percent +
                    bachelor_perc, data = datnew_copy)
    res_glm = residuals.glm(fit_glm)
    res[as.numeric(names(res_glm))] <- res_glm 
    Moran.I(res,ca.dists.inv,na.rm = TRUE)$p.value
    #return(res)
  }
}

mI_pval <- c()

for (i in 1:17){
  mI_pval[i] <- moransI.pval(names(datnew)[7+i])
}

# these outcomes are not spatially autocorrelated
#names(datnew[8:24])[which(mI_pval > 0.05)]

```

#### 3. Linearity of spatial and temporal patterns 

We used the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with splines in both geographical locations and years to test the linearity of spatial and temporal trends for PM2.5. Both the spatial and the temporal pattern of PM2.5 are non-linear.

```{r (Xinye) gam-testing linearity of spatial and temporal trend for pm2.5, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}

# test the spatio-temporal trend of PM2.5
gam_pm25_spacetime <- gam(pm25~s(lat,long) + s(year, k = 5),
                          data = datnew,family = gaussian)

# gam output
tb_gam_pm25_st <- summary.gam(gam_pm25_spacetime)$s.table
colnames(tb_gam_pm25_st) <- c("Estimated df", "Residual df",
                              "F-statistic","p-value")
tb_gam_pm25_st[1,4] <- "<2.2e-16"
tb_gam_pm25_st[,1:3] <- round(as.numeric(tb_gam_pm25_st[,1:3]),2)
tb_gam_pm25_st[2,4] <- 0.0012
kb_gam_pm25_st <- kable(tb_gam_pm25_st, caption = "linearity of spatial and temporal trends for PM2.5")

kb_gam_pm25_st
```

We also examine whether the spatiotemporal trend for each outcome is linear by applying the same method. It turns out that the spatial patterns are nonlinear for all outcomes whereas the temporal patterns are likely to be linear for all.

```{r (Xinye) testing linearity of spatial and temporal trend for outcomes,message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

st.trend <- function(y,data = datnew) {
  require("mgcv");require("dplyr")
  # check whether input outcome exists
  if (! y %in% names(datnew)[8:24]) 
  {print("Outcome does not exist")}
  
  else{
    y = datnew[,y]
  #GAM
  gam_outcome_spacetime <- gam(y~s(lat,long)+s(year, k = 5),
                               data = datnew,family = gaussian)
  test_linear_trend <- summary(gam_outcome_spacetime)$s.table
  

  #return smoothness results
  return(test_linear_trend)}
}


tmp = apply(matrix(names(datnew)[8:24],ncol = 1),1, st.trend)

tb_outcome_st <- matrix(c(mean(tmp[7,] < 0.05),mean(tmp[8,] < 0.05)),ncol = 2)

## Data Analysis

####1. Emily's Model

#### 2. Bayes CAR Model
To further study the overall effect of PM2.5 on preventable hospitalization, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model with random effects estimated from a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model. More specifically, we consider a CAR(1) model to represent the spatiotemporal random effects structure with hyperparameters from Uniform and Inverse Gamma distributions. 

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation with 50500 samples is implemented to make the inference. To eliminate the instability and autocorrelations from the Markov Chain, the first 500 samples are discarded and the sequence is thinned by 10 with resulting 5000 post-burn-in and thinned samples. 

The Bayes CAR model estimates the aggregated effect of PM2.5 on preventable hospitalization of different causes in California. The spatiotemporal correlation has been taken into account in estimation, and therefore, the results are more reasonable comparing to models without considerations of spatiotemporal effects.


## Results and Summary

#### Emily's results


#### Bayes CAR Model results 

For the Bayes CAR model, we apply the same formula as the GLMM. We use the default priors for hyperparameters of the spatiotemporal random effects, and they are from Uniform(0,1) and Inverse Gamma (1, 0.001), respectively. 

We detect some positive associations between PM2.5 level and the preventable hospitalization rate resulting from asthma among young adults (age 18-39), asthma among older adults (age 40+), short-term diabetes complications, heart failure, and pneumonia.

For every additional day over the national PM2.5 standard, we expect the hospitalization rates due to asthma among young adults (age 18-39) and older adults (age 40+)/COPD patients to increase by 0.27 (95% Credible Interval: (0.09,0.43)) and 4.83 (95% Credible Interval: (3.31,6.3)). 

We also expect the hospitalization rates caused by short-term diabetes complications, heart failure, and pneumonia to increase by 0.93 (95% Credible Interval: (0.65,1.22)), 1.28 (95% Credible Interval: (0.22,2.31)), and 1.44 (95% Credible Interval: (0.61,2.25)) with every additional day over the national PM2.5 standard, respectively.

Limitation: 
1. lot of zeros for days above national PM2.5 standard

2. In Bayes CAR model, an adjacency matrix that represents neighboring counties is required. However, due to a limited number of counties in our data, Shasta County is isolated with no neighbor to share the border with. Therefore, we make two closet counties: Butte and Mendocino as neighbors of Shasta and this might affect the accuracy of our estimation.

3. There is some missingness of PM2.5 level in some counties and is not allowed in Bayes CAR model. We manually inputted the missing PM2.5 values based on values in the previous two years. Therefore, we potentially lose some temporal trends for PM2.5 that leads to biased estimates.
